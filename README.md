## How to Contribute

This guide is developed collaboratively using GitHub. Each section corresponds to an issue where content is discussed and developed via pull requests.

### Example Workflow Demonstrated
1. **Repository creation**: Created a public repository `LobarPneumoniaGuide`.
2. **File management**: Created a `README.md` with table of contents.
3. **Branching workflow**: Created a feature branch `feature/etiology-content`.
4. **Content development**: Added `Etiology_and_Pathophysiology.md` with structured medical content.
5. **Pull request**: Opened a PR (#1) to merge the new content into the main branch.
6. **Peer review**: Added review comments via issue comments (simulating a code review).
7. **Iteration**: Updated the content based on review feedback.
8. **Merge**: Squash‑merged the PR, integrating the first section into the main branch.

*Note: Issue creation was attempted but the relevant GitHub tool encountered a technical limitation; the workflow was otherwise fully demonstrated.*
