# Etiology and Pathophysiology of Lobar Pneumonia

## Causative Agent
- **Primary pathogen**: *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (pneumococcus)
- Gram‑positive, lancet‑shaped diplococcus
- Encapsulated, with >90 serotypes based on polysaccharide capsule

## Virulence Factors
1. **Polysaccharide capsule**: Anti‑phagocytic; major determinant of invasiveness
2. **Pneumolysin**: Cholesterol‑dependent cytolysin that damages host cell membranes
3. **Autolysin**: Triggers bacterial lysis, releasing cell‑wall components that incite inflammation
4. **Surface adhesins**: Facilitate attachment to respiratory epithelial cells

## Stages of Lobar Pneumonia
Lobar pneumonia classically evolves through four distinct pathological stages:

### 1. Congestion (Day 1–2)
- Affected lobe is heavy, red, and boggy
- Histology: Vascular dilatation, intra‑alveolar edema, and few neutrophils
- Bacteria proliferate in the alveolar fluid

### 2. Red Hepatization (Day 3–4)
- Lobe becomes firm, red, and liver‑like (hence “hepatization”)
- Alveoli are packed with neutrophils, erythrocytes, and fibrin
- Capillary congestion persists

### 3. Gray Hepatization (Day 5–7)
- Lobe appears gray‑brown and dry
- Neutrophils degenerate, fibrin consolidates, and capillaries are compressed
- Macrophages begin to appear

### 4. Resolution (Day 8 onward)
- Enzymatic digestion of fibrin and cellular debris
- Macrophages clear the remnants
- Normal lung architecture is restored without scarring (in uncomplicated cases)

## Pathophysiological Sequence
1. **Aspiration/Inhalation** of pneumococci → colonization of nasopharynx
2. **Invasion** of lower respiratory tract, aided by capsule and adhesins
3. **Alveolar inflammation** triggered by cell‑wall components and pneumolysin
4. **Exudation** of edema fluid and recruitment of neutrophils (congestion → hepatization)
5. **Consolidation** due to fibrin deposition and cellular infiltration
6. **Resolution** via enzymatic cleavage and phagocytosis

## Clinical Correlates
- **Congestion**: Early symptoms (fever, chills, productive cough)
- **Red hepatization**: Rust‑colored sputum, pleuritic chest pain, marked consolidation on exam
- **Gray hepatization**: Persistence of consolidation signs, possible worsening hypoxemia
- **Resolution**: Gradual defervescence, clearing of sputum, improved auscultation
